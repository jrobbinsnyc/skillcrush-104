			<h4>Having OCD makes you a cleaner coder!</h4>
			<p>Here's a place where being obsessive about the details is a huge plus! Every word, ever character you type, matters. Nothing out of place. All your code beautifully aligned so that corresponding parts are placed above/below each other.  It's a thing of beauty when your code looks nice and is easy to read.</p>

			<p>Be obsessive! Be picky! You will be happier as you work and anyone having to read or edit your code will be thankful, and coding will go more smoothly.</p>

			<h4>Ask Questions, even "dumb" ones.</h4>
			<p>It's likely that someone else, or many others, have the same question you have, so ask away! Make note of any questions you have as you are practicing.  Sometimes you will see a pattern in your confusion.</p>

			<p>Other people enjoy helping you learn -- take them up on their kindness and desire to assist. Their experience is priceless.</p>
